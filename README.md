## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a workflow for the reliable identification of adulterated maple syrups, vegetable juices etc. from their fluorescent excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). The project began with an ANN, with the ultimate goal being to use a CNN to identify which adulterant at which percentage (if any) is present.
